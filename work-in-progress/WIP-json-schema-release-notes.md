title: JSON Schema Draft-07 Release Notes
layout: page
---

There are a few breaking changes with newer keywords based on community feedback,
and internally there has been a lot of restructuring through a new concept called
vocabularies, but on the whole things are mostly the same.

* TOC
{:toc}

- Update to RFC 8359 for JSON specification
- Add the concept of formal vocabularies, and how they can be recognized through meta-schemas
- Formalized annotation collection
- Moved applicator keywords from the Validation specification as their own vocabulary
- Define "$ref" behavior in terms of the assertion, applicator, and annotation model
- Note undefined behavior for "$ref" targets involving unknown keywords
- Additional guidance on initial base URIs beyond network retrieval
- Allow "schema" media type parameter for "application/schema+json"

### Keywords

* Eight brand new keywords were added
* One keyword was renamed
* One keyword was split in half
* One keyword in Core changed behavior
* One keyword in Hyper-Schema changed behavior
